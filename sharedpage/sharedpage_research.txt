This is my own research note on shared memory page, which is slightly different from http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Configuration_Memory#Shared_Memory_Page_For_ARM11_Processes

I do all test only on Old 3DS

Virtual Address | Type  | Value and description
0x1FF81000       u32     DateTimeUpdateCount
                         Increase by one each Time the date time gets updated (once per hour)
                         The first update seems set this to 1.

                         Similar to SystemTickRate=268MHz
                         The first update seems write this with fixed value 0x0FFB0FF0
                         and following update write this with a calculated value
                         based on tick rate in the last hour.

                         The first update seems write this with fixed value 0

     +0x40       0x20 byte same structure as 0x20~0x40
*Two date time region (0x20~0x40 and 0x40~0x60) are update alternately.
 If DateTimeUpdateCount is even, the the first one is the most updated; otherwise the second one is.
